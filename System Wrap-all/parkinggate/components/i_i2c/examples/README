1. Introduction

The QuickStart Example Designs are static non-reconfigurable examples 
of complete complex subsystems utilizing our AMBA RTL (IIP) and verification 
(VIP) components. The purpose of these examples is to provide examples of 
how to integrate and test the different components in the context of a real 
subsystem. Programming examples for each device are provided in both Verilog 
and C code. The stimulus runs from either a Synopsys AHB master BFM 
(under the control of Verilog or C commands) or from a real CPU simulation 
model running the C code from within the AMBA subsystem. Support for ARM-946 
and MIPS-4KE CPU's is provided. Simulation scripts that run out-of-the-box 
will help you get to waves within 30 minutes.


2. Getting Started

A coreConsultant user preferences file called .synopsys_rt.setup is supplied and 
can be copied as follows into your home (~) directory. 

cp $DESIGNWARE_HOME/iip/data/amba_html/latest/synopsys_rt.setup ~/.synopsys_rt.setup


3. Documentation

Relevant documentation is available on the AMBA Welcome HTML Page in coreConsultant and
also at the following locations:
